# LIRI-node-app

 LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

 ## LIRI will always require the node and liri.js files to be called

 1. "movie-this" LIRI will check the OMDB API for the movie title input by user. If no movie is requested, will default to Mr. Nobody.
